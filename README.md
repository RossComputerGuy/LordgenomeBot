# Lordgenome

The Lordgenome bot for the /r/GurrenLagann Discord server. To install the bot, clone the repository, edit `config.json` and set the `token` property to your bot token given to you on the developer application page. Starting the bot is done by running `node index.js`. The bot adds fun commands that references the show and has fanart searching abilities. There may be an easter egg or two in the code.
